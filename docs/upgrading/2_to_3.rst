Upgrading to nornir 3.x from 2.x
================================

Changes in the plugin ecosystem
-------------------------------

Since nornir 3.0.0 plugins are relocated in separate project to reduce the dependency list of nornir.
In short it means you have to install nornir and the plugins you need for your project.

Connection plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connection plugins need to register the connection class to the entry point ``nornir.plugins.connections`` in the installation process.
``InitNornir()`` detects and registers the plugins under the entry point automatically.
For consistency the plugin name should be stored in the variable ``CONNECTION_NAME``.

You can check the following how to for more details on `how to <../howto/handling_connections.rst>`_ create a plugin.

Install the napalm connection plugin::

    pip install nornir-napalm

Manual registration::

    from nornir.core.connections import Connections
    from my_plugin.connections import MyPlugin

    Connections.register("my_plugin", MyPlugin)

Verify registration::

    from nornir.core.connections import Connections

    Connections.get_plugin("my_plugin")

Inventory plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expect of the ``SimpleInventory`` the inventory plugins are moved to separate projects.

Install the netbox inventory plugin::

    pip install nornir-inventory


Task plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Task plugins are moved to separate projects and must be installed.

Install the napalm tasks::

    pip install nornir-napalm


In order of this change the import statement changes for example from::

    from nornir.plugins.tasks.networking import napalm_cli

to::

    from nornir_napalm.tasks import napalm_cli

Process plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Processor plugins are moved to separate projects and must be installed.

Install the napalm tasks::

    pip install nornir-print-result


In order of this change the import statement changes for example from::

    from nornir.plugins.processors.print_result import PrintResult

to::

    from nornir_print_result.processors import PrintResult
